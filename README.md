# FYP-MachineLearning-RecommenderSystem
Auto-Efficiency – Machine Learning for Predictive Analysis and Car Recommender System

The Project was built in an Anaconda Environment, so here are the steps to replicate it.

1. There is a yml file containing the Anaconda Environment called 'FYP_TensorFlow'.

2. Import this environment into Anaconda Navigator to rebuild it.

3. Open Visual Studio Code from the Anaconda Navigator Environment

To start the enviroment run in the integrated terminal:

conda activate FYP_TensorFlow

To run the application run from two separate terminals:

ionic serve --lab

and

conda activate FYP_TensorFlow

npm run start-flask-api
